GitGlance AI Dashboard
<!-- Replace with a real screenshot URL -->

GitGlance is a full-stack, AI-powered web application designed to provide deep, at-a-glance analytics for GitHub user profiles. Created for developers, hiring managers, and technical recruiters, it transforms a standard GitHub profile into a rich, interactive dashboard, saving time and revealing key insights about a developer's activity, skills, and focus.

This project evolved from a simple command-line tool into a complete, containerized, high-performance web service with an AI-driven feature set, demonstrating a wide breadth of modern software engineering principles and technologies.

‚ú® Core Features
Interactive Web Dashboard: A clean, dynamic, and responsive UI built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Comprehensive Profile Analytics: Displays key stats, top languages (visualized with Chart.js), and pinned repositories.

AI-Powered README Summaries: Integrates the Gemini API to provide on-demand, AI-generated summaries of any project's README file, saving recruiters valuable time.

Deep Activity Insights: Features a custom-built backend process to analyze a user's event history and calculate their longest consecutive contribution streak.

Infinite Scroll: A "Load More" feature allows users to seamlessly browse through a developer's entire repository history.

Shareable URLs: The application state is managed in the URL, allowing users to share direct links to a specific user's dashboard.
